# DOM-API-Task

This is a piece of CSS and JavaScript code that fetches data from the Star Wars API and displays it on a web page.

The CSS code sets the background color of the body, removes bullet points from unordered lists, and applies styling to elements such as list items, headings, paragraphs, and images.

The JavaScript code fetches data from the Star Wars API using the Fetch API and then iterates over the results to create a list item for each character. It also assigns an appropriate image for each character based on their name. The data is then inserted into the HTML document using template literals, and appended to the unordered list element with the ID "container-list".

Overall, this code dynamically generates content based on data fetched from a remote server and displays it on a web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
